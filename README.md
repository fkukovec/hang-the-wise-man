# Hang the Wise Man

Hang the Wise Man is a clone of the classic Hangman game where the user must guess a randomly fetched quote. In the game, the letters are masked and the user inputs their guesses using either the keyboard or the mouse. The number of mistakes is tracked, and the game ends after 6 incorrect guesses.
